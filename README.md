# MIRAD: A Method for Interpretable Ransomware Attack Detection

In this repository we open-source a method for training interpretable models,
originally developed for ransomware attack detection.

Key features:
- model and prediction interpretability
- concise implementation based on `numpy` and `pytorch`
- efficiency: training can be executed on a CPU, evaluation is fast
- extensibility: model structure allows easy enforcement of task-specific requirements by additional regularization

We also include everything necessary to reproduce experiments we conducted to publish our results.
